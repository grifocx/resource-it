# IT Resource Management Application - Design Guidelines

## Design Approach
**Design System Approach**: Using **Fluent Design** principles optimized for productivity and information-dense enterprise applications. This system excels at data visualization, complex workflows, and professional tool interfaces that IT teams use daily.

## Key Design Principles
- **Clarity and Efficiency**: Prioritize quick data scanning and task completion
- **Information Density**: Display maximum relevant information without overwhelming users
- **Professional Aesthetics**: Clean, modern interface that builds confidence in the tool
- **Workflow Optimization**: Minimize clicks and cognitive load for daily operations

## Core Design Elements

### A. Color Palette
**Light Mode:**
- Primary: 220 90% 45% (Professional blue for primary actions)
- Secondary: 220 15% 25% (Dark gray for text and secondary elements)
- Background: 0 0% 98% (Light neutral background)
- Surface: 0 0% 100% (White cards and panels)
- Success: 142 70% 45% (Green for completed tasks)
- Warning: 38 100% 50% (Amber for attention items)
- Error: 0 70% 50% (Red for critical issues)

**Dark Mode:**
- Primary: 220 90% 60% (Lighter blue for accessibility)
- Secondary: 220 15% 75% (Light gray for text)
- Background: 220 15% 8% (Dark blue-gray)
- Surface: 220 15% 12% (Elevated dark surfaces)

### B. Typography
- **Primary Font**: Inter (Google Fonts) - excellent for data-dense interfaces
- **Monospace**: JetBrains Mono (Google Fonts) - for time entries and technical data
- **Hierarchy**: 
  - H1: 2rem (32px) - Page titles
  - H2: 1.5rem (24px) - Section headers
  - H3: 1.25rem (20px) - Card titles
  - Body: 0.875rem (14px) - Primary text
  - Small: 0.75rem (12px) - Metadata and labels

### C. Layout System
**Spacing Primitives**: Tailwind units of 2, 4, 6, and 8
- p-2, m-2 (8px) - Tight spacing within components
- p-4, m-4 (16px) - Standard component padding
- p-6, m-6 (24px) - Section spacing
- p-8, m-8 (32px) - Major layout divisions

### D. Component Library

**Navigation**
- Horizontal top navigation with breadcrumbs
- Sidebar with collapsible sections for different work types
- Quick action floating button for common tasks (log time, update availability)

**Data Displays**
- **Resource Cards**: Team member availability with capacity bars and current assignments
- **Work Item Tables**: Sortable columns with priority indicators, effort estimates, and assignment status
- **Kanban Boards**: Drag-and-drop work prioritization with swim lanes
- **Timeline Views**: Gantt-style resource allocation visualization
- **Dashboard Widgets**: Key metrics with subtle borders and consistent spacing

**Forms**
- **Time Logging**: Quick-entry forms with auto-complete for work items
- **Availability Management**: Slider controls for capacity setting
- **Work Item Creation**: Multi-step forms with validation and progress indicators

**Interactive Elements**
- **Priority Indicators**: Color-coded badges (red=critical, amber=high, blue=normal, gray=low)
- **Capacity Meters**: Horizontal progress bars showing current utilization
- **Status Pills**: Rounded badges for work item states
- **Action Buttons**: Primary (filled), secondary (outline), and ghost variants

**Overlays**
- Modal dialogs for detailed work item editing
- Slide-out panels for quick actions and notifications
- Tooltip overlays for additional context on data points

### E. Animations
**Minimal and Purposeful**
- Subtle hover states on interactive elements (opacity changes only)
- Smooth transitions for drag-and-drop operations (200ms duration)
- Loading spinners for data fetching
- **No decorative animations** - focus on immediate usability

## Special Considerations
- **Dense Information Layout**: Optimize for scanning large amounts of structured data
- **Quick Actions**: Prominent access to frequently used functions like time logging
- **Status Visualization**: Clear visual hierarchy for work priorities and team capacity
- **Cross-Platform Consistency**: Ensure design works equally well on desktop and tablet devices

This design framework creates a professional, efficient interface that IT teams can use confidently for daily resource management without visual distractions from their core workflow.
